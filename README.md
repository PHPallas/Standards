# Standard Web Development Act (SWDA)

The SWDA is a collection of best practices for web development within the PHPallas team. This repository is driven by a manifest of best practices.

## Keywords

Throughout the SWDA, we frequently use several terms in capital letters. This document defines these terms to clarify their meanings for all contributors.

### MUST

The term **MUST**, along with the terms **REQUIRED** or **SHALL**, indicates an absolute requirement of the specification. Contributor are obligated to follow all rules dictated by this term. Violating these rules is not acceptable under any circumstances.


### MUST NOT

The phrase **MUST NOT**, or **SHALL NOT**, signifies an absolute prohibition within the specification. This emphasizes the importance of avoiding bad practices.

### SHOULD

The word **SHOULD**, or the adjective **RECOMMENDED**, suggests that there may be valid reasons in specific circumstances to deviate from a particular term. However, the full implications of such a deviation must be understood and carefully considered before choosing an alternative approach. Contributors are not obligated to follow the rule but must clarify their reasons for not adhering to the recommended practice.

### SHOULD NOT

The phrase **SHOULD NOT**, or **NOT RECOMMENDED**, indicates that there may be valid reasons in specific circumstances where a particular behavior is acceptable or even beneficial. Nevertheless, the full implications should be understood and the case carefully evaluated before implementing any behavior described with this label.

### MAY

The term **MAY**, or the adjective **OPTIONAL**, signifies that an item is entirely optional. A contributor may choose to include the item if it is applicable and beneficial in a particular context, while another contributor may decide to omit it. An implementation that does not include a particular option **MUST** be prepared to interoperate with another implementation that does include the option, potentially with reduced functionality. Conversely, an implementation that includes a particular option **MUST** be prepared to interoperate with another implementation that does not include the option.
